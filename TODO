unshield
--------
 try unshield for .cab files that do not extract with cabextract.
 Those would be Installshield CAB files rather than Microsoft CAB files.

How to decode Metamail contents?
================================
 The firt part is usually html, and thus file -i says text/html
 ignoring the mime headers.

 Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
 Content-Type: multipart/
 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=Unknown.jpeg;
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME

metamail -w -x < saved-mail-body-from-mutt
## often says says
# metamail: Incomplete multipart message -- unexpected EOF
# Cannot handle any part of multipart/alternative message

# when I extract the parts between the boundary string and feed this
# to metamail one by one, it works well.
env METAMAIL_TMPDIR=. metamail -d -w jpeg.mm
 This message contains 'image/jpeg`-format data.

 which is being decoded and written to the file named "./Unknown.jpeg".
 If you do not want this data, you probably should delete that file.
 Wrote file ./Unknown.jpeg
