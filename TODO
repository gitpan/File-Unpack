lib/ldig/fs.pm had this on its sub get_file_mimetype(): "file -i -b %s"
# file returns things like:
# 'text/plain; charset=us-ascii'
# 'application/x-tar, POSIX'
# 'text/x-c'
# we truncate at the , or ;
#
# If $fname ends in '|' we assume it is a command like 'gzip -dc file.gz|'
#
# vim-7.0-extra.tar.bz2/vim70/csdpmi4b.zip~ldig/BIN/CWSDPMI.DOC
# is a text file, but file says: application/x-shockwave-flash

# FIXME: DELTA rpms have DLT3 magic after unrpm. How do we handle this?

unshield
--------
 try unshield for .cab files that do not extract with cabextract.
 Those would be Installshield CAB files rather than Microsoft CAB files.

How to decode Metamail contents?
================================
 The firt part is usually html, and thus file -i says text/html
 ignoring the mime headers.
 
-> file_unpack -v -m 
  shows the multipart; header in the third filed.

 Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
 Content-Type: multipart/
 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=Unknown.jpeg;
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME

metamail -w -x < saved-mail-body-from-mutt
## often says says
# metamail: Incomplete multipart message -- unexpected EOF
# Cannot handle any part of multipart/alternative message

-> use perl-MIME-tools, this is more flexible.

# when I extract the parts between the boundary string and feed this
# to metamail one by one, it works well.
env METAMAIL_TMPDIR=. metamail -d -w jpeg.mm
 This message contains 'image/jpeg`-format data.

 which is being decoded and written to the file named "./Unknown.jpeg".
 If you do not want this data, you probably should delete that file.
 Wrote file ./Unknown.jpeg
